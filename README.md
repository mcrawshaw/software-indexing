A master store for high-level software asset metadata. This could be anything from a spreadsheet to a vendor product.

- Broadly consumable
- Acts as a launching pad (e.g. web links) to reach more detailed information in other systems
- Open for read/write by other systems (APIs & Webhooks)

Some aspects of a bad software index might include:

- Hard to access or rest
- Too complex to be broadly consumable
